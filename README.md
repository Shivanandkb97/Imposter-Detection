# Imposter Detection System

## Overview

The **Imposter Detection System** is an advanced deep learning solution designed to identify fraudulent activities and unauthorized access with high accuracy. By leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and custom datasets, the system effectively analyzes patterns and behaviors to detect imposters in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Identifies imposters as they attempt unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.
- **Streamlit-based Interface**: User-friendly front-end built with Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization.
- **Advanced Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes custom-built deep learning models, trained on comprehensive datasets.
- **Custom Datasets**: Includes datasets like NUAA and Yonsei University for robust training and validation.
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized algorithms ensure precise and reliable detection outcomes.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects anomalies through in-depth pattern and behavior analysis.


## Front-End and Application Flow

The system includes a **Streamlit-based web application** that serves as the front-end for users to interact with the model. The core application logic is handled in the `app.py` file, which:
1. Provides an intuitive interface for uploading image files.
2. Displays results in real-time after processing inputs through the model.
3. Offers visualization of detected patterns or anomalies.

## Datasets

The project uses both publicly available datasets and custom-built datasets for training and evaluation:
- **NUAA Dataset**: A facial dataset for spoof detection.
- **Yonsei University Dataset**: Real and fake face datasets for deep learning.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Data is gathered from multiple sources to create a diverse and balanced dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, resized, and normalized for model compatibility.
3. **Model Training**: The system uses advanced neural networks, including a custom-built **Fake Net Model**, to train for imposter detection.
4. **Evaluation**: The models are rigorously evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
5. **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed for real-time imposter detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Development Tools**: Google Colab
- **Data Handling**: Numpy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How It Works

1. Upload an image for analysis.
2. The system analyzes the input using trained deep learning models.
3. A real-time decision is made, categorizing the input as **Genuine** or **Imposter**.
